Formatting the prompt as an instructionï¼š
1.Before formatting the prompt, the generated output was:

myenv(base) yolopei@yolodemacbook-air assignment2 % python call_api.py
[{'generated_text': "Hello! I'm excited to be here today to discuss the"}]

After applying the formatted structure, the response changed to:

myenv(base) yolopei@yolodemacbook-air assignment2 % python call_api.py
[{'generated_text': '<|im_start|>user\nHello!<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nHello! How can I help you today?'}]

The key difference is that, in the first case, the model continues generating text as if it were completing a passage, whereas in the second case, it recognizes the structured prompt and responds in a conversational format. The formatted version clearly distinguishes between the user and assistant roles, making the interaction more structured and aligned with a dialogue-based model.

2.Multi-turn conversation log:
[{'generated_text': "<|im_start|>user\nHello!<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nHello! How can I help you today?<|im_end|>\nuser\nI'm looking for a new hobby. What are some popular ones?<|im_end|>\nassistant\nSome popular hobbies include painting, playing music, gardening, and cooking."}]
